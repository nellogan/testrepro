<p>AwakeOnLANMobile enables you to send Wake On LAN (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN">WOL</a>) packets, allowing you to remotely wake up your devices over either a local area network (LAN) or over the internet. It supports IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The application offers several features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open Source</strong>: Licensed under GPLv3 License with zero advertisements and no account creation necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Local Storage</strong>: Add, edit, or delete device information for easy access.</li>
<li><strong>Network Scanning</strong>: Discover devices using either an IPv4 address or CIDR notation for subnets (e.g., 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.1.1/24). Choose between PING and TCP connect (sent to Port 443) packets for scanning. PING will require 1 second per IP address, while TCP connect will be faster.</li>
<li><strong>Theme Toggle</strong>: Switch between a light and dark mode theme to customize the appearance based on your preferences. The selected theme will be persisted even after shutting down the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Developed with React Native (Typescript) and utilizes C++ turbo modules for native level socket access when sending and receiving packets. The ./cpp directory contains lightly modified code from 'https://github.com/nellogan/awakeonlan' and 'https://github.com/nellogan/netscan'. These are Linux commandline utilities that can be used in lieu of this application if your device supports a terminal (such as Termux or the new Android AVF Linux terminal).</p>
